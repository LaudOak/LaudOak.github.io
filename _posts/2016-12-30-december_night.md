## December Night

---

The cold slope is standing in darkness

But the south of the trees is dry to the touch

The heavy limbs climb into the moonlight bearing feathers

I came to watch these

White plants older at night

The oldest

Come first to the ruins

And I hear magpies kept awake by the moon

The water flows through its

Own fingers without end

Tonight once more

I find a single prayer and it is not for men

*W. S. Merwin*

寒冷的山坡立在黑暗中

而树林的南面摸上去是干燥的

沉重的枝干攀进长满羽毛的月光

我走来，注视这些

白色植物在夜里更显苍老

那最老的

将最先化为灰烬

我听见被月亮照醒着的喜鹊

水穿过自己的手指

无尽流淌

今夜，再一次

我寻到一种祈祷而它不是为了人类
